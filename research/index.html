			<h3>1. Housing Tenure and Unemployment</h3>
			<p>In this article, we test whether tenure choice influences employment. This influence might arise through a number of channels: the time and expense involved in selling a house might discourage owner households from moving; home-owners might use their housing equity as a cushion, allowing them to search longer for work; home-owners might encourage zoning that discourages business development, and underwater home-owners might wish to avoid the equity call or default that would happen upon the sale of a home. These factors could collectively have either a positive or negative effect on employment outcomes. Using Current Population Survey panel data from 1988 to 2013, we conclude that tenure rates do not statistically reduce employment growth rates. Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics data from 1994 to 2013 and Survey of Income and Program Participation data from 2004 to 2013, we conclude that home-owning does not increase peoples' unemployment probabilities or significantly increase people's unemployment spells or decrease people's incomes. Indeed, after controls, home-owning is a positive correlate for workersâ€™ employment outcomes. However, home-owning does correlate with longer employment durations and lower mobility. </p>
